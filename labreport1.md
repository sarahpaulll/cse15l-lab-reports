# Tutorial to log into course-specific account on ieng6
This tutorial will have three steps:
  1. Installing VSCode
  2. Remotely Connecting
  3. Trying Commands

If you already have VSCode downloaded on your computer, as I did, you may skip this step. However, if you do not have VSCode go to the Visual Studio Code website at this [link]( https://code.visualstudio.com/) and follow their instructions in order to download and install it. Be sure to install the correct version for your operating system (mac, windows, etc). Once installed visual studio code should appear like ![this](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122580017/212500609-3b42d5d6-7967-47a0-981c-92cba7ddca09.png).


To remotely connect to the server you will first have to download git using this [link](https://gitforwindows.org/) for windows and for mac users type in git -- version into the terminal. Once git is downloaded open a terminal in VSCode using ssh followed by your course-specific account, for example cs15lwi23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu, which can be found at this [link](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php). Then once connected it will ask you if you want to keep connecting in which case you type yes. Next it will prompt you to enter your global password which can be set on the when you look up your course-specific account [here](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php). ![remote server]( 

Now it is time to run some commands. Run some commands on both your computer and on the remote computer, such as cd, ls, mkdir, pwd, cp, cat, etc. To log out of the remote server in the terminal you can click ctrl-D and run the command exit.
